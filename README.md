# DLNN
A MATLAB spin-off of the Coursera Course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" from deeplearning.ai 

Having done most of my image analysis work in MATLAB, I'm absolutely torn deciding between MATLAB and Python. While Python offers a lot of libraries that are being constantly updated, I like the more consistent and simpler feel that MATLAB has.

I've read and re-read some articles on the same, but switching to a language is almost always painful and I think with time MATLAB will have more or less all the functionalities required for DL. 

As a result of this, I'm trying to implement all the weekly programming assignments for the course using MATLAB. I'm not sure if it'll all work, but some work-arounds have to exist for everything.

Cheers.
